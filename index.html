<img src="img/bf-sauteed-kale-1-s4x3-jpg_3.jpeg"/>

<p>INGREDIENTS:</p>
<li>1-1/2 pounds young kale, stems and leaves coarsely chopped</li>
<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely sliced</li>
<li> 1/2 cup vegetable stock or water</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
    
<p>DIRECTIONS:</p>

<p>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft, but not colored. Raise heat to high, add the stock and kale and toss to combine.

<p><h3>Giada De Laurentiis' Pasta Primavera</p></h3>
<img src="img/ei1c05-pasta-primavera-jpg_3.jpeg"/>

<p>INGREDIENTS:</p>
<li>3 carrots, peeled and cut into thin strips</li>
<li>2 medium zucchini or 1 large zucchini, cut into thin strips</li>
<li>2 yellow squash, cut into thin strips</li>
<li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 yellow bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
<li>1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried Italian herbs or herbes de Provence</li>
<li>1 pound farfalle (bowtie pasta)</li>
<li>15 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan</li>
</p>

<p>DIRECTIONS:</p>
<p>Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees F.
On a large heavy baking sheet, toss all of the vegetables with the oil, salt, pepper, and dried herbs to coat. Transfer half of the vegetable mixture to another heavy large baking sheet and arrange evenly over the baking sheets. Bake until the carrots are tender and the vegetables begin to brown, stirring after the first 10 minutes, about 20 minutes total.

<p>Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, tender but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. 
Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid.</p>

<p>Toss the pasta with the vegetable mixtures in a large bowl to combine. Toss with the cherry tomatoes and enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten. Season the pasta with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve immediately.</p>

<p><h3>Rhee Drummond's Pan Fried Pork Chops</p></h3>
<img src="img/1384789067362.jpeg"/>
 
<p>INGREDIENTS:</p>
<li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning</li>
<li>8 pork breakfast chops</li>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>Smashed new potatoes for serving</li>
    
<p>DIRECTIONS:</p>
<p>Salt and pepper both sides of the pork chops. Combine the flour and some cayenne, salt and black pepper. Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, and then set aside on a plate.</p>

<p>Heat the canola oil over medium to medium-high heat. Add the butter. When the butter is melted and the butter/oil mixture is hot, cook 3 pork chops at a time, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook until the chops are golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining pork chops. Serve with smashed new potatoes.</p>
